# Hello there,

* This is my source code from the subject "Java with OOP Laboratory" at FPT University. You must achieve at least 750 locs (lines of code) in order to pass this subject (and luckily I did :D). By completing each assignment, you will get a certain amount of loc that is proportionate to its difficulty, ranging from 25 to 175. 
* In my opinion, these assignments are quite well-structured and comprehensive (have been reviewed by one of the strictest CS lecturer in my area ðŸ¤”). Viewers - especially those at FPT Uni can consider them as an useful consulting resource. However, I strongly recommend that you should understand the assignment structure and all lines of code before applying them to your own product. Otherwise, the review process with lecturer will be much more complicated than you've ever expected ;)
## Hope this resource helps you guys! Happy coding ðŸ’»
