# Hello there,

* This is my source code from the subject "Java with OOP Laboratory" at FPT University (and luckily I pass :D). It comprises of 7 assignments ranging from easy (Bubble Sort) to difficult (Fruit Shop Management)
* In my opinion, these assignments are quite well-structured and comprehensive (have been reviewed by one of the strictest CS lecturer in my area ðŸ¤”). Viewers - especially those at FPT Uni can consider them as an useful consulting resource. However, I strongly recommend that you should understand the assignment structure and all lines of code before applying them in your own product. Otherwise, the review process with lecturer will be much complicated than you've ever expected ;)
## Hope this help you guys! Happy coding ðŸ’»
